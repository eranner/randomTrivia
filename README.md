# Random Trivia Generator
This is a single page application that generates random trivia questions based on your selected category.

It uses a free online API https://the-trivia-api.com/. It also uses bootstrap for the navbar.

Click a link at the top and you will receive a random trivia from that particular category.
Once the question loads, if you click on the question, the answer will be revealed.
If you want to stay on that category, hit the button at the bottom of the page to load another, if not, go to another category in the nav bar.

Improvements to be made
Currently you can get a multiple choice question. As it currently stands, there is no way to handle the options. This feature could be added by generating another
div if the API returns multiple choice answers.
It would also be nice to enter an input box to answer the question and check to see if you are correct. This would open up different possibilities as well
such as a scoreboard, or competitive play
